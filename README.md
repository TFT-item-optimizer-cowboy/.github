## 🔍 What Is the TFT Item Optimizer?

The **TFT Item Optimizer** is a tool that hooks into your game and automatically suggests (or even builds) the **most optimal item combinations** based on your current units, traits, and board state.

Think of it as your **personal Challenger coach** sitting behind you, whispering “don’t put Warmogs on your carry again, bro.”

You can use it in **manual mode** (suggestions only) or **auto mode**, where it builds the items as soon as you have components. Either way, you’ll never waste a chain vest again 🧱

## ⚙️ Core Features

### 🎯 **Auto BIS (Best-In-Slot) Builder**

Instantly calculates the strongest possible item combo for your comp – based on meta stats and real-time unit synergies.

### 🧪 **Anti-Troll Item Filter**

Prevents builds like double Zeke’s on your carry or Swordbreaker on a tank. Stops grief items before they ruin your round.

### 📊 **Meta-Based Suggestions**

Pulls from the most popular and highest winrate builds – constantly updated based on current patch trends.

### 🔀 **Component Prioritizer**

Decides what to hold vs slam depending on game state – great for early vs late scaling.

### 💡 **Item Position Sync**

Automatically adjusts unit positions to match their items. Example: puts Morello carriers near the front, or RFC/Void statics in the backline.
